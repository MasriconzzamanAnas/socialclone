There are too many users. I give some users access to test the project.
1. is a super user access: user: admin; password: admin.
2. is normal user access: user: Asma_Jihad; password: as123456*+
3. is normal user access: user: admin2; password: as12345*+

OR you can create a normal user account.

To preview this project pull the project to your machine 
first install  $ pipenv shell
after that install all dependencies by $ pipenv install --dev
now run the project by $ py manage.py runserver.
